## React Pizza Store 🍕

A simple front-end pizza store built using NextJS, CSS and a dash of PayPal Elements. I did this project to get more comfortable with NextJS.

## Features ✨

```
Shopping cart - See and edit your order.
Checkout page - for the purposes of this demo website,
you can make a paypal developer account to populate fields.
PayPal was used to create the Payment section's UI. Order
confirmation page displays customer and order details
and a button to start the fun all over again.
```

## Get up and running 🚀

```
yarn install
yarn dev
# or
npm i
npm run dev
```
